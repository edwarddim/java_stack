**Card Games Hackathon!**

Purpose: To create a card game using Java. It can be any game! Black Jack, Texas Hold’em, Pai gow, or anything you could think of! Here are some ideas for you. 

Level 1: Who is bigger?
-	Computer and player both select a random card from a deck. If your card is bigger than the other one, you win. Otherwise, you lose.
-	Requirements:
o	Each card can be selected ONCE only. 
o	If the cards have the same value, the suit will decide who one is bigger.
	i.e. Spade 4 is bigger than Heart 4.
o	Bonus: You can make the game for more than 1 player. 
o	Bonus: Instead of winning from a bigger card, you can guess if your card is bigger or smaller than the other card. And you win if your guess is right. 

Level 2: Black Jack
-	Create a game for 2 players to play Black Jack. 
-	Each player is given 2 random cards. If the total value of 2 cards is less than 21, they have the option to hit (draw one more random card) OR to stay (not to draw one more card). If the total value of the cards is greater than 21, it busted and lose. The player can hit more than once. 
-	Values of J, Q, K are 10. Value of Ace is either 1 or 11 depending your own preference.  
-	A player can win, lose or tie. 
-	Requirements:
o	Each card can be drawn ONCE only. 
o	Bonus: You can make the game to Computer Vs Player. For a computer, if the total value is less than 17, they have to hit. 
o	Bonus: You could play 10 rounds with a base of 20 points and bet it like the real game!
